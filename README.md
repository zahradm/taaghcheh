[Taaghche](https://taaghche.com/) is an online platform dedicated to book enthusiasts, providing an extensive collection of reading materials. To enhance the user experience, I have developed a series of APIs for analyzing the [Taaghche dataset.](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saeedtqp/taaghche/), allowing users to delve deeper into the world of books.

The APIs available in this repository include:

- [X] API for retrieving a book's mean rating:

    * Given a book name, this API calculates and returns the average rating based on user reviews. It offers a quantitative measure of a book's overall reception, aiding readers in their selection process.
- [X] API for identifying the most frequent word in a book's comments:

  * This API analyzes user comments associated with a specific book and determines the word that appears most frequently. By highlighting the predominant topic of discussion, readers can gain valuable insights into the book's key themes.
- [ ] API for conducting sentiment analysis on a book's comments:

  * Utilizing natural language processing techniques, this API assesses the sentiment of user comments related to a particular book. It categorizes the overall sentiment as positive, negative, or neutral, allowing readers to gauge the general reader sentiment towards the book.
